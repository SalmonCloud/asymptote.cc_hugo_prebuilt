# Peering Policies

Asymptote Network operates using the autonomous system AS53616.

We have an open peering policy, no minimum traffic requirements at this moment.

We require an up-to-date PeeringDB entry for all public peering requests, including exchange information with properly formatted public fabric addresses, ASNs, and NOC/peering contact information.

We ask that peers also maintain their private peering facility details, as we use this information for private peering (PNI) targeting.
