# Who We Are
We are Asymptote Network LLC. Our business started in 2023 as a group of IT enthusiasts who were dedicated to providing infrastructures with privacy protection in mind. Each of our co-founders, namely Brandon, Chris, and Roger, has their own skill sets which work well together to ensure the smooth running of our IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) business.

Asymptote Network LLC is strategically positioned across two key global locations to serve your needs: Hurrican Electric Fremont2 based in Fremont, United States, and TGT Datacenter located in Hong Kong. This strategic presence allows us to maintain an unbroken service commitment, ensuring you are connected whenever and wherever you need to be.

Our facility in the United States, at Hurrican Electric Fremont2, puts us right in the heart of Silicon Valley, the global technology epicenter. This location gives us access to world-class IT infrastructure, cutting-edge innovations, and the capacity to meet the demanding requirements of our North American clients. Our presence here aligns us with the pace of the fast-evolving IT sector.

Across the Pacific, in the TGT Datacenter in Hong Kong, we provide our Asian clients with the same level of exceptional IaaS service. Positioned in one of Asia's central business hubs, our Hong Kong location allows us to tap into an important regional network, providing our clients with robust and resilient IT infrastructures that they can trust.

Both of our strategic locations house a comprehensive range of our services. These include data storage and management, network services, and server hosting, among others. We utilize high-level encryption and privacy safeguards to ensure your data remains secure and protected. Regardless of your geographical location, we are committed to providing our clients with IaaS solutions that prioritize privacy protection and cater to their unique business needs.
