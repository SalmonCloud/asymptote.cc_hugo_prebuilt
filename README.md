## When Updating Geofeed
Please change both `geofeed.txt` and `geofeed.csv` under `static/`.  
I tried to implement a shell script to automate the process,
but apparently Cloudflare Pages refuses to run my shell commands.
Therefore, we have to do it manually at the moment.
I'll try to find a solution for that.
